Search Recipes
Search through thousands of recipes using advanced filtering and ranking. NOTE: This method combines searching by query, by ingredients, and by nutrients into one endpoint.

If you are making a "what's in your fridge?" style app and require more filters than the Search Recipes by Ingredients endpoint allows, use the sort parameters max-used-ingredients or min-missing-ingredients with this endpoint instead.

Quotas
Calling this endpoint requires 1 point and 0.01 points per result returned. Since this endpoint combines the capabilities of four different endpoints into one, additional points may be required depending on the parameters you set. If fillIngredients is set to true, 0.025 points will be added per recipe returned. If a nutrient filter is set, 1 point will be added. If addRecipeInformation is set to true, 0.025 points will be added per recipe returned. If addRecipeInstructions is set to true, 0.025 points will be added per recipe returned. If addRecipeNutrition is set to true, 0.025 points will be added per recipe returned and addRecipeInformation will automatically be set to true as well. Learn more about quotas.
